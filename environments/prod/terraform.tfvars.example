# Production Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your actual values

# IMPORTANT: Production configuration - handle with care!
# - Ensure all values are thoroughly reviewed before applying
# - Use separate service accounts and access controls from dev/stage
# - Consider using different regions for disaster recovery

# Basic project settings
project_id     = "mycompany-mlops-prod"
project_number = "234567890123"  # Get this from GCP Console or 'gcloud projects describe'
region         = "us-central1"    # Consider multi-region for production workloads
zone           = "us-central1-a"  # Consider multiple zones for high availability

# Production-specific configuration notes:
# - Use production-grade service accounts with minimal required permissions
# - Enable audit logging and monitoring
# - Implement proper backup and disaster recovery strategies
# - Consider using Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)
# - Review and implement appropriate network security controls
