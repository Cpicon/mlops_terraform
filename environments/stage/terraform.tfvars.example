# Stage Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and update with your actual values

# Basic project settings
# The stage environment should use a separate GCP project from dev/prod
project_id     = "mycompany-mlops-stage"
project_number = "123456789012"  # Get this from GCP Console or 'gcloud projects describe'
region         = "us-central1"
zone           = "us-central1-a"

# Stage-specific configuration notes:
# - Stage environment typically mirrors production configuration
# - Used for final testing before production deployments
# - Should have restricted access compared to dev
# - Consider using the same region as production for accurate testing
