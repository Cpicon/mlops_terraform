## Detailed Flow

### 1. Developer Workflow (DEV Environment)

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev/add-new-resource
   ```

2. **Local Development**
   - Edit Terraform files
   - Run `terraform plan` locally
   - Run `terraform apply` locally for testing

3. **Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   git push origin dev/add-new-resource
   ```
   - âœ… **Triggers**: Auto-deployment to DEV environment
   - ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**: Validate changes work in cloud environment

### 2. Stage Deployment Process

1. **Open Pull Request**
   - From: `dev/add-new-resource`
   - To: `develop`
   - âœ… **Triggers**: Plan generation for STAGE environment
   - ðŸ“‹ **PR Comment**: Shows exact changes that will be applied to stage

2. **Review Process**
   - Reviewer examines the Terraform plan
   - Checks for:
     - Resource changes
     - Security implications
     - Cost impact
     - Naming conventions

3. **Merge PR**
   - âœ… **Triggers**: Auto-deployment to STAGE environment
   - ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**: Test changes in production-like environment

### 3. Production Deployment Process

1. **Open Pull Request**
   - From: `develop`
   - To: `main`
   - Opened by: DevOps Engineer 1
   - âœ… **Triggers**: Plan generation for PROD environment
   - ðŸ“‹ **PR Comment**: Shows exact changes that will be applied to production

2. **Review Process**
   - Reviewed by: DevOps Engineer 2 (different person)
   - Checks for:
     - All stage testing completed
     - Change window compliance
     - Rollback plan availability
     - Business approval (if needed)

3. **Merge PR**
   - âœ… **Triggers**: Auto-deployment to PROD environment
   - ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**: Apply changes to production

## GitHub Actions Behavior

### Trigger Matrix

| Event | Condition | Environment | Action |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| `push` | Branch: `dev/*` | DEV | Plan & Apply |
| `pull_request` | Target: `develop` | STAGE | Plan Only (Comment) |
| `pull_request` | Merged â†’ `develop` | STAGE | Plan & Apply |
| `pull_request` | Target: `main` | PROD | Plan Only (Comment) |
| `pull_request` | Merged â†’ `main` | PROD | Plan & Apply |
| `schedule` | Daily 1 AM UTC | PROD | Plan & Apply |
| `workflow_dispatch` | Manual | DEV | Plan & Apply |

### Key Features

1. **Environment Isolation**
   - Each environment has separate state files
   - Service accounts are environment-specific
   - No cross-environment access

2. **Plan Visibility**
   - PRs show plans for **target** environment
   - Reviewers see exact changes before merge
   - No surprises after deployment

3. **Safety Mechanisms**
   - No direct push to `main` or `develop`
   - Two-person rule for production
   - Automated drift detection (daily)

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Adding a New BigQuery Dataset

1. Developer creates `dev/add-analytics-dataset`
2. Pushes branch â†’ DEV auto-deploys
3. Opens PR to `develop` â†’ Shows STAGE plan
4. Team lead reviews, approves â†’ STAGE auto-deploys
5. DevOps opens PR to `main` â†’ Shows PROD plan
6. Another DevOps engineer approves â†’ PROD auto-deploys

### Scenario 2: Emergency Hotfix

1. Create `dev/hotfix-permissions`
2. Test in DEV (auto-deploy on push)
3. Fast-track PR to `develop` with urgent label
4. Quick review and merge â†’ STAGE deploys
5. Immediate PR to `main` with emergency approval
6. Deploy to PROD after second approval

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Naming**
   - Use descriptive names: `dev/add-logging`, `dev/fix-iam-binding`
   - Include ticket number if applicable: `dev/JIRA-123-update-vpc`

2. **PR Descriptions**
   - Explain the "why" not just the "what"
   - Link to relevant documentation
   - Include rollback instructions for prod PRs

3. **Review Checklist**
   - [ ] Plan shows expected changes only
   - [ ] No unintended deletions
   - [ ] Cost impact is acceptable
   - [ ] Security best practices followed
   - [ ] Naming conventions adhered to

## Troubleshooting

### PR Shows "No Changes"
- **Issue**: PR from dev branch shows no changes in plan
- **Cause**: Changes already applied to target environment
- **Solution**: This is expected if you tested in that environment

### Plan Fails in PR
- **Issue**: Terraform plan fails when PR is opened
- **Cause**: Usually permission or syntax issues
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check workflow logs
  2. Verify service account permissions
  3. Run `terraform validate` locally

### Merge Doesn't Trigger Deployment
- **Issue**: PR merged but no deployment happens
- **Cause**: Branch protection or workflow conditions
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify branch protection allows merges
  2. Check workflow conditions match
  3. Ensure PR was actually merged (not closed)

## Security Considerations

1. **Service Account Impersonation**
   - No key files stored
   - Workload Identity Federation for auth
   - Per-environment service accounts

2. **State File Protection**
   - Encrypted at rest in GCS
   - Versioned for recovery
   - Access logged and audited

3. **Change Auditability**
   - All changes via PRs
   - GitHub maintains audit log
   - Terraform state history preserved
